## Project Overview üìÑ

The 2022 IPL season featured high-level cricket, excitement, and close competition. In this project, I examine various aspects of the tournament, including match results, player contributions, and venue statistics. For the analysis and visualization, I use Python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
